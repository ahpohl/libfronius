/** Serial number of the inverter
 *
 * Please note, that the inverter serial number is not supported on all devices
 * and also depends on the internal inverter controllerâ€˜s production date and
 * its software version.
 *
 * If the inverter serial number is not supported, then two fallbacks are
 * implemented that are still unique but may not match the inverter serial
 * number printed on the nameplate:
 *
 * 1: Serial of inverter controller (PMC) if supported
 * 2: Unique ID (UID) of inverter controller
 *
 * For SYMOHYBRID inverters the inverter serial number is not supported and this
 * addrister always contains one of the two implemented fallbacks.
 *
 * Please note further that due to startup timing issues or synchronization
 * faults this field may change its value during operation from one option to
 * another, e.g. at boot time only UID is available and after some time device
 * information is synchronized then this field changes from UID to PMC or
 * inverter serial number.
