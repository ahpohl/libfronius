/** Serial number of the inverter

 Please note, that the inverter serial number is not supported on all devices
 and also depends on the internal inverter controllerâ€˜s production date and its
 software version.

 If the inverter serial number is not supported, then two fallbacks are
 implemented that are still unique but may not match the inverter serial number
 printed on the nameplate:

 1: Serial of inverter controller (PMC) if supported
 2: Unique ID (UID) of inverter controller

 For SYMOHYBRID inverters the inverter serial number is not supported and this
 register always contains one of the two implemented fallbacks.

 Please note further that due to startup timing issues or synchronization faults
 this field may change its value during operation from one option to another,
 e.g. at boot time only UID is available and after some time device information
 is synchronized then this field changes from UID to PMC or inverter serial
 number.
